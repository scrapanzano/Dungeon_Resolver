# What is Dungeon Resolver

Dungeon Resolver is a project developed initially as a university assignment for the "Intelligent Systems" course, focusing on Automated Planning. The project utilizes the unified-planning library to implement a planner and simulator for resolving randomly generated dungeon instances.

Unified-planning reads the [pddl dungeon domain file](https://github.com/scrapanzano/Dungeon_Resolver/blob/master/dungeon_domain.pddl), that define the dungeon's structure, specifying the problem types (object), predicates (fluents), functions (numerics) and the actions that a hero can performe inside its.

> [!NOTE]
> A dungeon is made up of rooms, connected to each other, sometimes separated by closed doors: inside them it's possible to find treasures, keys, enemies, weapons and healing potions. 

Instead, for the pddl dungeon istance file is possible to choose one of the following option:
- **Generate and solve a random dungeon instance**: 

- **Solve an already existing dungeon instance**:
